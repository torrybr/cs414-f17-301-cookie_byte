Here is how to setup a game in, hopefully, enough detail.

1) Create two Users

2) Create a new Gameplay object and give it your two users.
		The constructor when you create the Gameplay object will create and setup your board
		automagically.
		
3) Create a MakeMove object
		
4) MakeMove.movePiece handles everything for actual playing of game. UI should call MakeMove.movePiece
		with rowFrom, colFrom, rowTo, colTo. 
		
		
What I didn't do:

User needs to be rewritten. Once that happens, see the TODO markers in MakeMove.movePiece for saving the winner and 
storing histroy somehow (you can add an ID to Gameplay if you think that's the right thing to do). Winner can be fetched from Gameplay.getWinner.
