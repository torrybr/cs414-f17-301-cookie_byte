Here is how to setup a game in, hopefully, enough detail.

1) Create a new board

2) Create two Users (at time of writing, User still needs to be redone)

3) Create a new Gameplay object and give it your board and two users.
		The constructor when you create the Gameplay object will setup your board
		automagically.
		
4) MakeMove.movePiece handles everything for actual playing of game. UI should call MakeMove.movePiece
		with rowFrom, colFrom, rowTo, colTo. 
		
5) UI should handle any user-facing error messages, such as "Move not valid". 
		If you want, you can put these messages in MakeMove.isMoveValid() so that you can say things like
		"Not your turn" or "Piece in the way, please try again". 
		
		
What I didn't do:

User needs to be rewritten. Once that happens, see the TODO markers in MakeMove.movePiece for saving the winner and 
storing histroy somehow (you can add an ID to Gameplay if you think that's the right thing to do). Winner can be fetched from Gameplay.getWinner.
